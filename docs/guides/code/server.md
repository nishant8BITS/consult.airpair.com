AirPair's backend is written on NodeJS with ES6.

## 2. Values

The following headers represent values, in order of priority that drive the
coding style guidelines chosen for this project.

Sometimes these consideration play nicely in tandum, other times there are
trade offs. Whilst not every case should a discussion result in the order
here always being enforces, the majority of times we expect it to.


### 2.1 Terse readable code

One of the reasons jQuery became extremely popular was it's convention
driven terse syntax that made reading easy and coding faster.

The less characters and lines, the less comprehension, typing and
scolling. Thus the following guidelines were chosen.

**Use ES6 Syntax**

**Leave out semi-colons**

**Omit One Line `if` and `function` braces**
