## Why

We want to build a better airpair.com FASTER. Watch this repo and feel free to learn with us and give feedback as we merge pull requests.

## Tech

To start this project will look similar to the v1 airpair site (live Dec '14 - Oct '14') with nodeJS on the backend and Angular 1.3 on the front-end. The intent is to shortly move to Angular 2.0
