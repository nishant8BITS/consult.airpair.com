# experts.airpair.com

Open Sourced front-end expert features of airpair.com

## Why

We want to build a better airpair.com FASTER. Watch this repo and feel free to learn with us and give feedback as we merge pull requests. If you're interested in being paid to help code features, get active on this repo as a first step.

## Tech

The full version of airpair.com is written with the MEAN stack. This project will have no database component. Experts will be able to run the code against a staging server API.

To start this project will look similar to the full airpair site with nodeJS on the backend and Angular 1.3 on the front-end. The intent is to shortly move onto Angular 2.0
